## Robotics Competition by IIT Bombay - 2018

### Reached the semi-finals in the competition
### Track - Pollinator Bee

This repository consists of the code used to automate and simulate the drone for the competition. We automated a drone to detect different colored 
LEDâ€™s using OpenCV and Robot Operating System (ROS) and
programmed a simulation for the same using Virtual Robot Experimentation Platform (V-REP). We used the WhyCon localization 
system during the project to get the drone's position, did the required PID
tuning for the stability of the drone, and made the circuits for the competition environment.
